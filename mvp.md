# Venezuela's News Articles Analysis.

To this point, no modeling has been executed. Actually, I have crated a SQL Database that contains more than 6000 news articles. 

I have also created a diagram of the process, but I'm sure that it can be improved, as I get a better understanding of the steps involved in the process
of deploying a web app with Streamlit.

My next steps will be to train the NLP models, generate outputs and visualizations that will be store as static information, and then, 
begin the Streamlit app creation process.
